            <p>
        Chronic constipation is infrequent bowel movements or difficult passage of stools that persists for several weeks or longer.
            </p>
            <p>Constipation is generally described as having fewer than three bowel movements a week.</p>
			<p>Though occasional constipation is very common, some people experience chronic constipation that can interfere with their ability to go about their daily tasks. Chronic constipation may also cause excessive straining to have a bowel movement and other signs and symptoms.</p>
			<p>Treatment for chronic constipation depends in part on the underlying cause. However, in some cases, a cause is never found.</p>

        Causes
        </div>
        <div id="div8">
       <p>Constipation most commonly occurs when waste or stool moves too slowly through the digestive tract or cannot be eliminated effectively from the rectum, which may cause the stool to become hard and dry. Chronic constipation has many possible causes.</p>
	   <p>Blockages in the colon or rectum may slow or stop stool movement. Causes include:</p>
	   <ul>
	   <li>Anal fissure</li>
	   <li>Bowel obstruction</li>
	   <li>Colon cancer</li>
	   <li>Narrowing of the colon (bowel stricture)</li>
	   <li>Other abdominal cancer that presses on the colon</li>
	   <li>Rectal cancer</li>
	   <li>Rectum bulge through the back wall of the vagina (rectocele)</li>
	   </ul>
